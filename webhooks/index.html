    <h1>Webhooks</h1>
    <p>Webhooks are a way to receive real-time notifications when a specific event occurs. For example, you can receive a webhook when a new order is created in your store.</p>
    <p>Webhooks are sent as HTTP POST requests to a URL that you specify. The request contains a JSON payload with information about the event that occurred.</p>
    <p>For more information, see the <a href="https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/webhooks">Webhooks API documentation</a>.</p>
